# Classify Estonian text

Using [estnltk-textclassifier](https://github.com/estnltk/textclassifier), classifies Estonian text. Didn't work very well in tests with classifying [Postimees articles](https://github.com/taivop/postimees-rss) (see link to understand where my data came from) as interesting vs non-interesting based on the article title.

Dependencies:
* [estnltk](https://github.com/estnltk/estnltk)
* [estnltk-textclassifier](https://github.com/estnltk/textclassifier)
